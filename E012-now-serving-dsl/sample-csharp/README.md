## Being the Worst

This folder contains additional materials for **Kerry's HOMEWORK for Episode 12 - Now Serving DSL**:

* HOMEWORK Part 1 of 2:
* Part 1 will convert the Episode 11 Domain over to the new Episode 12 structure.
* Part 2 will come after Episode 13 when we learn about the updated specs/tests and migrate E11's Program.cs specs to the E13 Spec/ Domain.Tests format.

* Episode 12 Notes:
* CSharp sample project covering Application Services, Domain Services, and DSL code-generation
* This sample does not have an exe to run, it is code only.  A future episode will execute the Domain in a Test project.
* See "Visual Studio Settings" section on how to setup .ddd files:[ http://lokad.github.com/lokad-codedsl/](http://lokad.github.com/lokad-codedsl/)
* To execute a version of the Lokad-codedsl utility included in the sample, please launch the dsl.cmd inside of E012-now-serving-dsl\sample-csharp\dsl.cmd
* If you keep this DSL console utility running in the background it will automatically re-generate C# code in Messages.cs when you make changes and save the Messages.ddd file inside of the "Contracts" folder of the project.
